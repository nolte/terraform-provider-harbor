# Development

## Visual Studio Code DevContainer

For Easy development use [Visual Studio Code DevContainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), you can find the basement from the Development Containers at [nolte/vscode-devcontainers](https://github.com/nolte/vscode-devcontainers).

### Precondition for Use

* Create you Github Personal Access Token under [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the following scopes:
    * `read:packages`

* Login to fetch the required dev containers

```sh
    docker login docker.pkg.github.com
```

* Grab you a Coffee and wait for 3 Minutes (This happens on the first time use)
* Click Terminal -> New Terminal and execute the following command:

```sh
    make
```

## Process

| *branch*            | *description*                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ```master```        | The ```master``` will only used for Presentation, and the Deployment process.                                           |
| ```tags/release/``` | All Created Releases must be start with a ```release/``` prefix at the tag name.                                        |
| ```gh-pages```      | Branch for the Static HTML presentation, generated by the GitHub Release Workflow.                                      |
| ```develop```       | Branch for the current development, this branch will be used for integrate new Features, and starting the release flow. |
| ```feature/*```     | This are temporary branches for develop new functions.                                                                  |
| ```fix/*```         | Used for bugfixing from existing versions, if no FastForward Fix Possible.                                              |


Please use the ```develop``` branch for new features and fixes.


### Releasing

The [Github Release](https://github.com/nolte/terraform-provider-harbor/releases) Assets will be automatic attach from the build job see ```.github/workflows/go.yml```.
![Go](https://github.com/nolte/terraform-provider-harbor/workflows/Go/badge.svg?branch=master)  
For a Easy Release process we use the GitHub Commandline Interface [cli.github.com](https://cli.github.com/manual/).  
Each Release will be start from the ```develop``` branch.

```sh
TBD
```

## Build

The Build scripted at the moment splitted into the GitHub Workflow Stuff and a combination of Makefiles and Shell Scripts.  
The ```Makefile`` should be use for the local development, permanten using the full GitHub Workflows needs a lot of time.


### CI/CD

For local usage the GitHub Actions we use the [nektos/act](https://github.com/nektos/act) Project.
The first local execute will be take some time for pulling the large [nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/nektos/act-environments-ubuntu/tags) image.

### Docs

If you use the [VSCode DevContainer](#visual-studio-code-devcontainer), the [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) container will be started automatical, as a sidecar container.  
At the Development you ca access the current state from the Documentation at [127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
